Alex's notes and slides for teaching Ruby

# Showing the slides

We use a Ruby app called `deck` to generate and serve the slides. Install deck like this:

    gem install deckrb

## Showing all the slides

    deck run showoff.json
    
This will launch a local web server on port 4333. Open your browser to `localhost:4333`. 

On a Mac you can run:

    open http://localhost:4333

On Windows I think you can run:

    start http://localhost:4333

Use arrow keys to navigate slides. Press '?' to see a help window.

## Showing some of the slides

Same as above, but specify the slide files you want, e.g.

    deck run ruby-basics/strings.md

or 

    deck run ruby-objects/objects.md ruby-objects/classes.md


# Editing slides

Slides are in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) format.

Image files should be in, or relative to, the same directory as the slide source file that refers to them.

<!--
# Printing slides

Try this: first `gem install pdfkit`, then visit

    http://localhost:9090/pdf

but I make no guarantees!
