# Let's get started

Install Ruby, e.g.

    http://installfest.railsbridge.org

then open a terminal window and type this:

    git clone https://github.com/alexch/learn_ruby.git

    cd learn_ruby

then open `index.html` in a browser

# Very Important Tips!

## READ THE ERROR

This is actually very difficult to do, and very easy to miss.

## Make your console window REALLY TALL

## When you get an error, **SCROLL UP** and read down STARTING from where YOU HIT RETURN
